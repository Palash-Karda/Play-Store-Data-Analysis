# Play-Store-Data-Analysis

In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of apps available on the Google Play Store. The analysis was conducted using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore and visualize the relationships within the dataset.

Key Insights:
Some examples include:

Top 20 Apps with Rating > 4.5:
Filtered the apps with ratings above 4.5 and visualized the top 20. This allows us to quickly identify high-rated apps and their distribution across different genres and categories.

Apps and Installs According to Ratings:
Explored the relationship between ratings and the number of installs, revealing how app popularity (measured in installs) correlates with ratings.
Most Popular App Category (According to Ratings):

Analyzed the app categories and identified which ones had the highest average ratings, helping us understand the best-performing categories on the Play Store.
Category with Most Installs:
By examining the number of installs for each category, I determined which category of apps is the most downloaded and popular among users.
Top 20 Genres According to Ratings:

Explored the genres of apps and identified the top 20 genres with the highest ratings, helping to understand user preferences based on app type.
Category with Highest Ratings:
I found the app category that consistently receives the highest ratings from users, providing insight into which type of apps are favored.
App with Highest Number of Positive Reviews:

Identified the app that has garnered the highest number of positive reviews, showcasing the app's popularity and user satisfaction.

Visualizations and Plots:
Throughout the analysis, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various plots, including bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots, to visualize relationships between different features (like ratings, installs, and app categories etc).

Key visualizations include:
A bar plot of the top 20 apps with ratings greater than 4.5.
A scatter plot showing the relationship between app ratings and the number of installs.
A heatmap of category-wise ratings to identify the highest-rated categories.
A box plot to explore the distribution of ratings across different app categories.
And many more
